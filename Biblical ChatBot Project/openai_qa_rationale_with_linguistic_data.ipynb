#articulation: The indicate exploits the most general type of indication (i.e. ὁ) as a derivational marker (i.e. \"the article\"), which makes it possible to indicate an experience as conspicuous while also defining it using some other explicit definition. The resulting indication is expressed by an articular substantive.\n","   - #predicating: The move combines a generalization (a predicate) with an explicit introduction of an instantiating entity (a subject). This is the most frequently selected speech act type. Notably, it activates a number of additional modal systems related to interpersonal meaning that are not activated in the simpler speech act types (which are purely ideational).\n","   - alertness: The process is presented together with an explicit prompt to attend to it in a way that is alert to other potentially occurring experiences (i.e. to view either the process or its aftermath as an environment in which other things might be experienced). The verb employs a present or perfect stem.\n","   - circumstance: A wording explicitly construes some (informational or spatio-temporal) environment (e.g. where, when, why, how, etc.).\n","   - development_marker: Every move somehow advances a situation, but this one explicitly signals *how* by inserting a development marker (typically, a \"sentential conjunction\").\n","   - differentiated: The intrinsic definition isolates a single dimension along which experiences can be compared and contrasted with one another.\n","   - indicated: The differentiation explicitly indicate an experience as conspicuous (i.e. it is deictic). This signals that the experience is somehow prominent relative to relevant alternatives.\n","   - instantiator_construal: The predication explicitly construes whatever entity instantiates a predication's core generalization. It is expressed with a dependent wording that serves as an explicit grammatical subject.\n","   - internal_orientation: The proposition offers a representation that is explicitly marked as something that cannot be observed in reality but can only be \"observed\" internally (e.g. by memory or imagination). If the predicate is non-synchronic, it is expressed using a verb with a secondary personal ending (i.e. aorist indicative, imperfect indicative, pluperfect indicative, or optative). In the indicative, the verb normally takes the augment as a prefix.\n","   - objectifying: The subjective participant of the event is explicitly focused on some experience (i.e. an objective participant). In traditional terms, the verb is \"transitive.\"\n","   - preparatory: The inserted dependent supplies information that, for some reason or another, the reader needs to receive sooner rather than later. Consequently, it is expressed in a pre-core position. Notably, this is only possible if an inserted wording is a dependent. By comparison, independent wordings, translatives, and junctives have a more-or-less fixed position.\n","   - progressive: The positive operator explicitly marks an addition as progressively expanding a set. Other implied members may be explicit in the co-text or they may be presumed. The operator is expressed by δέ (or one of its compounds).\n","   - speech_act: The move advances a situation using speech (as opposed to some other modality). Almost every move in the NT is a speech act of some kind.\n","\n","## Discourse Data\n","This verse has 1 discourse features (these are useful heuristic interpretive annotations that tell you about the nature of the proposition a word is in):\n","- Main clauses are the top-level clauses in a sentence.
